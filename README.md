pygraph
========

Messing around with graph theory and wxWidgets. Will require wxpython2, python2.7 and matplotlib with the wx backend.

Should be run in python 2 eg: "python2 pyGraph.py". It does have a #! which on my computer points to the correct interpreter but I've got no idea if it'll be right on others. If the #! is pointing to the correct place then you can just run it as ./pyGraph.py.
